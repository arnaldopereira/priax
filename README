PRIAX VoIP Phone

See configuration sample and address book sample, go to ./docs/examples

Linux implementation read these files as ~/.priax and ~/.priax-book and
MS Windows as PRIAX_DRIVE\PRIAX\priax.conf and priax-book.txt.
PRIAX_DRIVE is an environment variable where default is C:.

On the configuration file, you will find IAX settings like user, pass,
host, caller ID, caller number, number of avaliable IAX lines to use
and default language.
The Address Book is very simple, you can edit it with your preferred text
editor before running priax, because it is read only once - when you
run priax.

Keyboard and PRIAX's Keypad:
Numbers from 0 to 9, # and * are valid keys on the keyboard and can also
be found on the PRIAX's keypad. If you want to call someone, just type
it's number and press the TALK button, or ENTER on the keyboard.
When you're already talking, numbers from 0 to 9 and # and * will
be sent as DTMF signals.
To hangup, press the HANGUP button or ESC on the keyboard.

Address Book:
When you're on the main screen you can access the Address Book by 
pressing the right arrow on the keyboard.
On the Address Book, TALK/ENTER will call the entry selected and
HANGUP/ESC will go back to the main screen.

Calls dialled, Calls received and Missed calls:
When you press TALK/ENTER with no numbers on the display, you go to the
list of 'Calls dialled', where you can find all numbers you already
dialled. Then, if you press the right arrow key on the keyboard you go 
to the 'Calls Received' list, and right arrow again let you access the
'Missed calls' list. To go back to the 'Calls Received' or 'Calls dialled'
you press the left arrow on the keyboard. It looks like a cell phone.
To go back to the main screen just press HANGUP/ESC.

Transferring calls:
When you're already talking with someone you can proceed as you do with
a regular phone, by pressing FLASH on the PRIAX's keypad and then typing
the number to call. When you HANGUP/ESC you transfer the call.

Internationalization:
PRIAX uses gettext so you can set environment variable LANG or change
'language =' option on the configuration file.
Linux path for .mo files is default:
-> /usr/share/locale/pt_BR/LC_MESSAGES/priax.mo (example)
Windows version of PRIAX will try to find .mo files under the PRIAX_BASE
dir - defaults to C:\PRIAX:
-> C:\PRIAX\locale\pt_BR\LC_MESSAGES\priax.mo (example)

When new strings are added to the code, a new .po file must be created
with the command: xgettext -C -o po/priax-pt_BR.po --keyword=_ *.c *.h
